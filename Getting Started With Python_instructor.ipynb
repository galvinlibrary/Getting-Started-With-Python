This workshop has been designed for students with no programming experience or for students who may feel intimidated by college level CS or Technology courses.  Our goal is to introduce programming and computational thinking in an accessible, low stakes, and easy to understand manner. __Getting Started with Python__ is the first workshop in a planned Python series designed to build student programming comfort and ability and display how programming and computational thinking can be used by students outside of traditional technology disciplines.\n",
